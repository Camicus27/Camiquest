# Camiquest

A top-down RPG adventure video game. Control a warrior hungry for adventure who stumbles upon an ancient structure. After claiming himself as a true hero and accepting a call to save a lost son, adventure awaits the warrior inside.

This is a personal project in development. I am developing the code, art, music, story-telling, and everything associated with the production of, hopefully, a fully commercial video game.

## About this repo
I may update this going forward, but I definitely want this to be public and completely free. Only some of the source code is public as seeing some internals would reveal spoilers or too good an understanding of the mechanics. I mostly want this to be publicly viewable for anyone curious as to what scripts are controlling the behind the scenes magic of this game as well as some of the raw assets used.

If this game were to go public and I decide to sell it commercially this will likely be taken down and further progress will be tracked through the games store page. You can find an already public store page on itch.io [here](https://camicus27.itch.io/camiquest).
