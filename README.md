# Camiquest

A top-down RPG adventure video game. Control a warrior hungry for adventure who stumbles upon an ancient structure. After claiming himself as a true hero and accepting a call to save a lost son, adventure awaits the warrior inside.

This is a personal project in development. I am developing the code, art, music, story-telling, and everything associated with the production of, hopefully, a fully commercial video game.

## About this repo
I may update this going forward, but I definitely want this to be public and completely free. I don't mind too much having the entirety of the source code public, though that may definitely change if something miraculous happens like this project gaining any form of popularity. I mostly want this to be publicly viewable for anyone curious as to what scripts are controlling the behind the scenes magic of this game as well as the raw assets used.

If this game were to go public and I decide it's good enough to even be considered a commerical game with a price tag, this whole page will likely be taken down or at least most of the source code removed.
