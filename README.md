# Camiquest

A top-down RPG adventure video game. Control a warrior hungry for adventure who stumbles upon an ancient structure. After claiming himself as a true hero and accepting a call to save a lost son, adventure awaits the warrior inside.

This is a personal project in development. I am developing the code, art, music, story-telling, and everything associated with the production of, hopefully, a fully commercial video game.
